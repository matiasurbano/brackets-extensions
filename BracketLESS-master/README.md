BracketLESS
===========

An 'on save' LESS compiler extension for Adobe Brackets.

Installation
============

1. Find your extensions folder by going to "Help -> Show Extensions Folder"
2. Extract the .zip to your Brackets extension directory
3. Start Brackets and enable the extension from the 'View' menu
4. Create a new LESS file, add some LESS code and save...
5. Voilà, you will see a CSS file of the same name in the  same directory

Usage
=====

After enabling BracketLESS as outlined above, the extension will try and 
parse any .less file when saved and output an identically named CSS file 
within the same directory.
